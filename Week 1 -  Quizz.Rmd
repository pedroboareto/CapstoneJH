twitter<-file("./final/en_US/en_US.twitter.txt","r")

bl<-readLines(blogs)
nl<-readLines(news)
tl<-readLines(twitter)

summary(nchar(bl))
summary(nchar(nl))
summary(nchar(tl))
```

#Question 4 - In the en_US twitter data set, if you divide the number of lines where the word "love" (all lowercase) occurs by the number of lines the word "hate" (all lowercase) occurs, about what do you get?
